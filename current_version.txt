2.3.2||
======New Version Information======

Now you can secretly flag one of your cards to be rezzed automatically at the start of your turn. 
The game will attempt to rez it just after you press F1 but before the scripts take effect.

This should hopefully help people who serially forget to rez their PAD/Adonis Campaigns before pressing F1 ;)

Find the new option under the "Rez" group in the card's context manu or use Ctrl+Shift+R.
If you change your mind, use it again to unset the auto rez flag.
