How to uncensor an .o8c file with your own scans.
================================================

1. Download the .o8c you want to uncensor (e.g. ```ANR-Humanitys-Shadow.o8c```) 
2. Change the file name from ```ANR-Humanitys-Shadow.o8c``` to ```ANR-Humanitys-Shadow.zip```
3. Extract the zip files and folders to a work folder.
4. File structure in the work folder will look like this:

5. Go to the "Cards" directory and replace the censored cards with uncensored scans. You must rename the uncensored cards exactly like the censored ones.
  One way to do this is to set the folder view into thumbnail mode, then open each uncensored image with an image editor like GIMP and save it over/ovewrite the appropriate censored card. The thumbnails should make it easy to see which is which.
6. Once all the cards are replaced, go back to the work folder, right click the first directory and comrpess to .zip  
7. Change the file name to ```ANR-Humanitys-Shadow.o8c```.
8. Done! Now you simply need to add it into OCTGN.
